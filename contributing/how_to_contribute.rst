How to contribute
=================

The Godot Engine is free and open-source. Like any community-driven project, we rely on volunteer contributions.
On this page we want to showcase the various ways you as users can participate - to help you find the right starting place with the skillset you have.
Because contrary to popular opinion, we need more than just programmers on the project!


Fundraising
-----------

- **Publish Godot Games.**
  You heard right, simply publishing a game #MadeWithGodot can positively impact the well-being of this project.
  Your personal success elevates the engine to a viable alternative for other developers, growing the community further.
  Additionally, it opens the doors for us to approach industry contacts about possible cooperations.


Technical contributions
-----------------------

- **Report bugs & other issues**
  As active users of the engine, you are better equipped to identify bugs and other issues than anyone else.
  To let us know about your findings, fill out this `bug report form <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/new/choose>`_ on our GitHub.
  Make sure to include as much information as possible to ensure these issues can easily be reproduced by others.

  If you are interested in helping keep our bug tracker organized, you can even join the `bugsquad <https://chat.godotengine.org/channel/bugsquad>`_!

- **Test Development Versions**
  While it is recommended to use the stable releases for your projects, you can help us test dev releases, betas, and release candidates
  by opening a copy of your project in them and checking what problems this introduces or maybe even solves.
  Make sure to have a backup ready, since this can produce irreversible changes.

- **Contribute Engine Code (mainly C++)**
  The engine development is mainly coordinated on our `Contributor RocketChat <https://chat.godotengine.org/>`_,
  so if you are serious about making PRs you should join us there!

  Read more about the **technical submission process**: :ref:`doc_first_steps`

- **Review Code Contributions**
  All pull requests need to be thoroughly reviewed before they can be merged into the master branch.
  Help us get a headstart by participating in the code review process.

  To get started, chose any `open pull request <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls>`_ and reference our **style guide**: :ref:`doc_pr_review_guidelines`

- **Write Plugins (GDScript, C#, & more)**
  Community addons are not directly included in the core engine download or repository, yet they provide essential quality of life upgrades for your fellow game developers.
  Upload your plugins to the `Godot Asset Library <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_ to make them available to others.

  ..
    update to talk about Asset Store later
- **Demo projects (GDScript, C#, and making Assets)**
  We provide new users with `demo projects <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/>`_ so they can quickly test new features or get familiar with the engine in the first place.
  At industry events, we might even exhibit these demo projects to showcase what Godot can do!
  Help improve existing projects or supply your own to be added to the pool, and join the `demo channel <https://chat.godotengine.org/channel/demo-content>`_ in the Contributor RocketChat to talk about it.
